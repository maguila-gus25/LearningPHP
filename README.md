### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: PHP Fundamentals

I am currently focused on mastering the fundamentals of PHP. This includes:

-   **Core Concepts:** Understanding syntax, variables, data types, and control structures.
-   **Object-Oriented PHP (OOP):** Learning about classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
-   **Database Interaction:** Working with MySQL/MariaDB to perform CRUD operations.
-   **Modern Practices:** Following PSR standards and using Composer for dependency management.

You'll find various small projects, exercises, and code snippets in this repository as I work through these topics.

### ðŸŒŸ Future Goal: Becoming a Laravel Developer

Once I have a solid grasp of PHP, my next step is to learn the **Laravel framework**. The ultimate objective is to apply these skills professionally and transition into a full-time developer role within my company. I am excited about the opportunity to build robust, scalable, and modern web applications with Laravel.
